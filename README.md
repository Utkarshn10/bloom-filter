# bloom-filter

A mini bloom filter

## How it works?
Bloom Filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure that works on the notion of False Positive i.e if a value doesn't exist then they may say it exists but if it doesn't then they will surely say that it doesn't exist.

## Trade of
It takes less memory in return for less accuracy

## How to run the bloom filter
```
1. Clone the repository
2. Install requirements
3. Run python bloom-filter.py
```

## Output
